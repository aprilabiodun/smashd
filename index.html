        <div class="box2">
			<p>The Cottage Food Law is a great opportunity for many food entrepreneurs who have been thinking about starting a food business or just hustling baked goods on the side for some extra cash, but have been reluctant to spend the money needed to establish or rent commercial kitchen space while investing in other mainstream order taking and delivery apps.</p>
				
			<p>Selling directly to consumers under the Cottage Food Law provides an opportunity for new, small scale food processors to "get their feet wet" and see if operating a food business is the right fit for them, without the initial overhead expenses.</p>

			<p>That's where SMASH'd comes in. SMASH'd is an app that allows small-scale, home kitchen-based food businesses to accept orders, payments and messages  while organizing, displaying and hiding menu items, ingredients and prices. No more lost or missed orders in your social media inboxes or post threads.</p>

			<p>So, are you ready to bring your kitchen mainstream?</p>
